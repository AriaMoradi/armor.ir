Personal website of Aria Moradi

This is the shittiest website possible and is intentionally done so to combat perfectionism and the need to know everything needed before doing anything.

Last time I programmed anything serious was almost a year ago, and I have been putting off doing it for too long.

The very first attempt you do at anything won't be flawless. Not doing it and playing mental wars with yourself is a bad idea and might result in putting off things for so long that you start being kind of scared of it.

So might as well do the shittiest version first to get a foot in the door and then do better the next time or iteration.
